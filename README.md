# Artists, behold!

Art is subjective, but you might not (always) want to be.

When dealing with customers, artists might encounter some blockers while closing deals, understanding their points-of-view or even dealing with customers from different nationalities, as the language barrier can end up being an issue. This solution's main purpose is to help artists to unblock their thought process or even making it easy to keep track of the context during long negotiations/deals.

**Functionalities:**
- LLM output based on context inputted by the artist (backend implemented).
- Inputting an array with the entire conversation (backend implemented).
- Inputting text/csv files with conversations (still in progress).

**Technologies used:**

Frontend:
- Nextjs
- Typescript

Backend:
- Python 3
- Flask

LLM:
- Llama 3.2 (locally hosted)

**Running the application:**

Backend: inside the main backend folder, run `python main.py`.
